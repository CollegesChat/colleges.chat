## Q: 有独立卫浴吗？没有独立浴室的话，澡堂离宿舍多远？

- A12124: Depends. Very few single rooms are in-suite (meaning that there's bathroom inside). The majority of the rooms share a bathroom with 10 to 20 other rooms. Usually, 3 to 4 showering cubicles are provided in such a shared bathroom.

## Q: 有晨跑吗？

## Q: 寒暑假放多久，每年小学期有多长？

## Q: 学校交通便利吗，有地铁吗，在市区吗，不在的话进城要多久？

- A12124: campus shuttles have several routes to carry you around the campus. There is an MRT station (CC24 Kent Ridge) near the east entrances of the campus, where the majority of the campus shuttle stops. Public buses also go through major roads inside campus and head to neighboring communities. The campus is not located in the downtown area. Clementi is the closest major community area with big shopping malls and foods, which takes less than 20 minutes to get by bus or MRT. Going to SG downtown, the MRT would take less than 1 hou# but students do not necessarily need to go to downtown area in a regular basis for food or entertainment.

## Q: 宿舍限电情况？

- A12124: Technically the usage of mini refrigerator and portable aircon is not allowed without management's permission. Extra bill of electricity would hence apply for such usage.
